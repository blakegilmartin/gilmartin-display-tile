              Follows the struggle of Richard Hendricks, a Silicon Valley engineer trying to build his own company called Pied Piper. In the high-tech gold rush
              of modern Silicon Valley, the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success. A comedy partially inspired by Mike
              Judge's own experiences as a Silicon Valley engineer in the late 1980s.
